# Jotideas - One place to jot down all your ideas
This was my first node.js application and it helped me learn lots of things about node.js

## Things I have learnt from this project

1. Writing first nodejs code using [expressjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
2. Handling login and registration of users
3. Hashing passwords and storing them in database
4. Use mongoose ORM for connection with Local MongoDB Database as well as Cloud Database [mLab](https://mlab.com)
5. Using server side templating using [Express Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) template engine
6. Added authentication using [passportjs](http://passportjs.org) with local strategy
7. Added authorization for the users to be able to view only their ideas even though they might change the URLs
8. Later while maintaining the project I also added confirmation of users by sending email with a token in the link to activate the account
9. Recently while learning Docker I added my first Docker Container starting with this project

and many more...
